Vimaansathi is a cross platform application that aims to automate Airport
experience by providing an end-to-end service. Our application is made to help
the commuters to plan their entire trip efficiently and safely by providing a
complete package where users can book flights, cabs, hotels, etc. In addition to
all these facilities, the user can also enjoy some premium facilities using loyalty
rewarded with every transaction. The feature that sets apart our application
from the rest is the fact that cab service is synchronized with the flight timing
which will decrease the waiting time for the cabs and helps the authorities in
terms of crowd management.

**Dynamic Dispatch**

Cab services plays a integral role in the applicaton which helps in syncronizing. The cab is dynamically dispatched using **Google's S2 Library** the same library Uber uses for demand and dispatch. 12,14,15 level cells were used for computations.
